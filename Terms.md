# Terms & Conditions
Last Updated: 2025-12-04

## 1. Overview
The Comment Edit Integrity Tracker ("the App") is a moderation support tool
intended for use in Reddit-based Mafia, Werewolf, and other social deduction
games. The App helps maintain game fairness by detecting and recording recent
edited comments within a subreddit.

By using, installing, or interacting with the App, you agree to these Terms.

## 2. Purpose
The App assists subreddit moderators and game hosts by identifying and
preserving short-term records of comment edits that could affect the outcome of
gameplay.

## 3. Acceptable Use
You agree to use the App only for:
- Subreddit moderation
- Game integrity assurance
- Reviewing edits that may impact ongoing games

You agree **not** to:
- Use the App for harassment, targeted monitoring, or non-moderation purposes
- Use the Discord integration to distribute user content outside moderation

## 4. Data Handling and Discord Integration
The App sends each tracked edited comment to a **private Discord moderation
channel**. This allows faster review and response by the moderator team.

You acknowledge that:
- The Discord channel must be private and accessible only to moderators.
- Messages sent to Discord are **temporary** and **deleted at the end of each game**.
- No long-term archive of edits is created.

## 5. Data Storage Limits
The App stores only the **most recent 1000 comments** in its internal
Redis cache. Older entries are automatically removed.

## 6. Disclaimer
The App is provided “as is” with no warranty. The developer is not liable for:
- Data loss
- Discord outages
- Reddit API changes
- Moderation decisions influenced by App output

## 7. Liability
Use of the App is at your own risk. The developer assumes no responsibility for
damages or disputes arising from community moderation actions.

## 8. Changes to These Terms
These Terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the App indicates
acceptance of changes.

## 9. Contact
Contact the developer via Reddit message or through the project repository.
